<p> The Arab world, as ancient as it is culturally rich, offers us a series of aromatic and delicious dishes that we could not fail to bring together in our collection of Arab cookbooks in PDF format, so that you can delight yourself with the best recipes and learn about the origins of this rich gastronomy.
    The Arab cookbooks that we present to you on this occasion, bring together the best of the food of the ancient Levant. The mixture offered by its dishes is really dazzling, as it gathers regional recipes from various parts of the Middle East, among which we can mention: Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Morocco, Turkey, Armenia and Palestine, among others. <br> Some recipes have been preserved from that period, such as tabbouleh, an exquisite couscous salad with vegetables; hummus, a peculiar chickpea cream with sesame and meze based on meat, vegetables and fruits.
    One of the most commonly used cereals in Arab cuisine is wheat, which forms part of one of the most popular dishes, such as kibbeh, a dough based on bulgur, onion and meat, seasoned with nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves, which is fried in the form of croquettes.</p>

    <H6 style="font-size: larger; color: palevioletred;"> OTHER INGREDIENTS</H6>
    <p>  3 garlic cloves • 2 cm fresh ginger • A small bunch of coriander • <br>A small bunch of fresh mint • 1 lemon<br>
        • 2 spoons of garam masala • 1/2 spoon of baking powder<br>
        • 2 spoons of pomegranate molasses • Salt and pepper • 8 small skewers softened in water <br>
        Dressing:
        • 4 dl greek yogurt (10% fat) • 1 spoon cumin roasted on a dry pan<br>
        • Lemon peel (from 1/2 lemon) • 2 tablespoons of olive oil<br>
        • Salt and pepper <br>
        Cabbage salad: <br>
        • 1 small pointed cabbage • 2 oranges • 1 red onion • 1 pomegranate<br>
        • 4 tablespoons of apple vinegar • A splash of olive oil • 3-4 springs of mint<br>
        • Salt and pepper</p>
        <h5 style="font-size: larger; color: palevioletred;"> LETS PREPARE OUR KEBAB!!!</h5>
        <p>Finely chop shallots, garlic and ginger and put it into a bowl. Zest lemons and squeeze the
            juice from half a lemon into the bowl. <br>Add chopped mint and coriander and mix it well
            together.
            
            In a new bowl add the minced beef and season with masala, baking powder, salt and pep-
            per. Blend it with your hands before you mix the two bowls together in a food processor.<br>
            
            Give it a good stir for 4-5 minutes so all the flavours blend nicely together.<br>
            Divide the meat paste into 8 portions and shape them in oblong sausage- like shapes.<br> Put
            them on wooden sticks and mould the meat firmly around them. Place the kebabs on a
            hot grill pan with some butter and fry them at high temperature. Brush the kebabs once
            in a while with a dressing of pomegranate molasses and the juice from half a lemon. <br>The
            more dressing you give the kebabs, the better the glaze and flavor.<br>
            After 6-8 minutes your kebab is done. Plate up with yogurt and salad.<br>
            Yogurt dressing: Grind the roasted cumin in a mortar and put it in your yogurt.<br> Add lemon
            peel, olive oil, salt and pepper.<br>
            Raw cabbage salad: Rinse the cabbage and remove the outer leaves. Remove the centre
            part and roughly chop into pieces. Chop the onion into thin slices and put it all in a bowl.<br>
            Remove the orange peel and cut it into chunks, removing the white pulp. <br>Put them in the
            bowl together with pomegranate seeds. Add chopped mint, vinegar, salt and pepper and
            mix it together. Drizzle with pomegranate glaze and serve right away.</p>

<h5 style="font-size: larger; color: palevioletred;">2.TZATZIKI SAUCE </h5>
<p>This is the cool and creamy sauce that is usually served as a condiment on Greek Gyro sandwiches.
    The recipe calls for the thicker Greek Yogurt, also called, “Greek Cheese”. <br>If you can’t find
    this type of yogurt, you can use plain regular yogurt from the grocery store.</p>
   <h5 style="font-size: larger; color: palevioletred;">LETS PREPARE OUR Tzatziki!!!</h5> 
<p style="font-style: italic;">1. Shred cucumber then spoon into cheesecloth and twist to remove liquids <br>
    Place in mixing bowl.<br>
    2. Measure and spoon yogurt into cheesecloth then twist to remove liquids.<br>
    3. Add strained yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, dill and mint to cucumber pulp
    and mix well.<br>
    4. Place in refrigerator for at least two hours before serving so flavours
    can blend. <br> <strong>Tips:</strong> 
    This will keep for a few days in the refrigerator, but you will need to drain.</p>
