    <h3 style="color: rgb(245, 11, 85);"> ATOMIC HABITS BY JAMES CLEAR &#9883;</h3>
    <p> This is one of favorite, I call it a self motivation and self intervention book. Its like the coffe you need to
        start your day, this book calls you out on your sh*t. <br> Its the book you read when you want stop certain
        habits and you find it hard, it gives you all the neccesary steps to stop those habits and motivates you to do
        better. <br>One of the statements that stood out for me in this book is " Whenever you predict that an
        opportunity will be rewaeding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation, And whenever dopamine rises, so
        does your motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward not the fulfillment of it that gets us to take
        action." isnt that beautiful! personally, i'll give it a solid 8/10</p>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(239, 8, 81);"> EAT LOVE PRAY BY ELIZABETH GILBERT &#127858; &#128591;&#10084;</h3>
    <p> uhmmm.... You know that book that speaks to you like it knows you? The type that feels like you wrote it? This
        is it for me... Its a book about a woman who fell out love and is trying to reinvent herself and get her mojo
        back <br> As the title indicates, she went on a food vacation, then a prayer vacation and found love at the
        end... beautiful right? one piece of unsolicited open opinion? "prioritize seld love" <br> One of the paragraph
        that got me was "I disappear into the person I love. I am a permeable membrane. If i love you, you can have
        everything. You can have my time, my devotio, my ass, my money, my family, my dog, my dog's money and time. If i
        love you, i'll carry for you all your pain, i will protect you from your own insecurity, i will give you the
        rain and the sun and if they are not available i will give you rain and sun check." <br> Isnt that beautiful? to
        have all these love to give? Personally i give the book a solide 8/10</p>

    <h3 style=" color: rgb(253, 8, 90);"> THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A FU*K BY MARK MANSON</h3>
    <p>In my opinion, in other to maintain a sane mind one needs to learn the art of not giving a fuck abot some things.
        the ability to take what you can, change what you can and ignore the rest. The desire for more positive
        experience is itself a negative
        experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of oneâ€™s. It's a 7/10 for me.
        negative experience is itself a positive experience.
