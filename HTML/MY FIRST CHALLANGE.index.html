    <h1>LOST LOVE</h1>
    <p>Nostalgia isn't what it used to be<br>
        Neither am I<br>
        Bewildered I am at how it turned out this way<br>
        Dreams and reality have to coexist<br>
        So they say<br>
        Unfortunately<br>
        That's the truth today<br>
        You see me and A  had a good thing going<br>
        We were more than compatible<br>
        This was a love incomparable<br>
        We held hands, kissed on the street<br>
        We were happy, it was neat</p>
